<br> <strong>(v0.9.1)-スナップショット</strong>
<br> - Added a loading spinner for the gallery
<br> - Testing out a feature where you can jump from an image in the wiki to the gallery to see credits. (Only works for Leo)
<br> - Using fallbacks again for images instead of locally storing them. Well, at least for the gallery.
<br> - Updated Leo from cat to leopard.
